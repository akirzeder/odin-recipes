    <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p>
            The author likes to talk about how much he likes his mother;s scalloped potatoes,
            and - shocking, I know - I also agree. Mom's make fantastic scalloped potatoes. 
            One of my favorite dishes my mom makes is scalloped potatoes and ham.

    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>3 large russet potatoes, or more to taste</li>
            <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Directions:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Grease a 2-quart casserole dish with 2 tablespoons 
                butter and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel potatoes and cut at a 45-degree angle into 
                1/4-inch thick round slices.</li>
            <li>Arrange 1/3 of the potato slices in an even layer 
                in the bottom of the prepared dish. Season the layer 
                very generously with salt, and sparingly with the 
                freshly ground black pepper, and cayenne, if using. 
                Top evenly with 1/3 of the Cheddar cheese. Repeat 
                this process two more times for a total of three 
                layers of potatoes, except for the last third of the 
                cheese. Slowly and carefully pour in the milk, without 
                upsetting the layers. The milk should almost, but not 
                quite, cover the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining Cheddar cheese and place the casserole 
                dish on a sheet pan to catch any drips.</li>
            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until potatoes 
                are tender and the top is well browned and bubbling, 
                about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
