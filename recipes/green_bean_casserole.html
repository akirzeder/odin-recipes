    <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Stir onions into the pan; cook and stir until very soft and golden brown, 
                about 15 minutes. Stir in sherry vinegar. Transfer to a small bowl, and reserve.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, melt 2 more tablespoons butter. 
                Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour. Stirring constantly, 
                cook over medium heat until flour smells like baked pie crust, 
                about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, 
                then whisk in nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, 
                and cook until thickened, whisking constantly, 3 more minutes. 
                Transfer to a bowl and reserve.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in clean skillet; 
                stir in panko until all crumbs are coated; reserve.</li>
            <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium heat, 
                and boil beans until bright green and crisp but not raw tasting, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Drain very well.</li>
            <li>Spoon half of the caramelized onions into the prepared casserole dish; 
                op with green beans. Season with salt and black pepper. 
                Spread reserved white sauce over the green beans; 
                sprinkle with half of the Gruyere cheese. 
                Top with the rest of the onions, and use the back of a spoon to 
                push onions down into sauce and cheese. Top with the buttered panko crumbs, 
                the remaining Gruyere, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot throughout and lightly browned, 
                about 30 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
